<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Resistant Polyurethanes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Density</li><li>Low Density</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flame resistant polyurethanes (FRP) can be classified into two main types based on their density: high density and low density. High density FRP refers to polyurethanes with a higher mass per unit volume, making them stronger and more rigid. They are often used in applications requiring enhanced structural integrity and fire resistance. In contrast, low density FRP has a lower mass per unit volume, offering more lightweight and flexible properties. These are commonly utilized in industries where weight reduction and flexibility are crucial, without compromising on fire safety.</p></p>
