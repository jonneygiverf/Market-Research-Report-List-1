<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cold Aisle Containment (CAC) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>For Raised Floor</li><li>For Non-Raised Floor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cold Aisle Containment (CAC) Systems market offers two main types: for raised floor and for non-raised floor installations. For raised floor installations, CAC systems are designed to separate the cold air and hot air by containing the cold aisle, typically formed by the cold air supply from the Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units. For non-raised floor installations, CAC systems create a contained cold aisle without requiring a raised floor infrastructure, using adjustable panels or curtains to separate cold and hot air. Both types effectively optimize cooling efficiency and improve data center energy usage.</p></p>
