<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Output Above 300 MW Condensing Steam Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombustion</li><li>Non-recombustion</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The output above 300 MW condensing steam turbine market can be classified into two types: recombustion and non-recombustion. In the recombustion market, the steam turbine is equipped with a reheat system where the steam is reheated after partial expansion in the high-pressure turbine. This increases the overall efficiency and power output of the turbine. On the other hand, in the non-recombustion market, the steam turbine operates without a reheat system and the steam expands only once in the high-pressure turbine before being condensed and reused.</p></p>
