<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Powder Inhaler Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capsule Based</li><li>Blister Based</li><li>Reservoir/Cartridge Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices are utilized for the administration of medication directly to the lungs. There are three main types of DPI devices: capsule-based, blister-based, and reservoir/cartridge-based. In capsule-based DPIs, the medication is stored in a small, individual capsule which is inserted into the device and punctured to release the powder for inhalation. Blister-based DPIs have pre-dosed pockets that contain the medication powder, which is released by piercing the blister. Reservoir/cartridge-based DPIs store the medication in a reservoir or cartridge, and the powder is dispensed by either a rotating disk or pressurized air.</p></p>
