<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Relief Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Mount</li><li>Horizontal Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure relief dampers are used in HVAC systems to relieve excess pressure in ductwork and prevent damage to the system. Vertical mount dampers are installed vertically in a ductwork system. They are commonly used in applications where space is limited, such as in tight ceiling spaces. Horizontal mount dampers, on the other hand, are installed horizontally in a ductwork system. They are typically used in applications where vertical space is limited, such as in cramped mechanical rooms or low-ceiling areas. Both types of dampers serve the same purpose of relieving pressure, but their orientation differs based on the specific installation requirements.</p></p>
