<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Platelet-rich Plasma Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure PRP</li><li>Leucocyte-rich PRP</li><li>Leukocyte-rich Fibrin (L-PRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Platelet-rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy is a regenerative treatment that uses a patient's own blood to promote healing and tissue regeneration. Pure PRP contains a concentrated amount of platelets, which release growth factors that stimulate cell growth and repair. Leucocyte-rich PRP also contains white blood cells, which aid in the immune response. Leukocyte-rich Fibrin (L-PRF) is a variation that includes fibrin, a protein that enhances the natural healing process. These different types of PRP therapy offer varying benefits depending on the specific needs of patients for effective treatment.</p></p>
