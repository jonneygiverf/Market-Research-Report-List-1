<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent Recycling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Site Solvent Recycling</li><li>Off-Site Solvent Recycling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solvent recycling refers to the process of recovering and reusing solvents that have been contaminated during use. There are two main types of solvent recycling markets. On-site solvent recycling involves the installation of equipment at the customer's facility, allowing them to recycle solvents on their own premises. This offers convenience and cost savings as it eliminates the need to transport the used solvents. Off-site solvent recycling, on the other hand, involves sending the used solvents to a specialized facility for recycling. This option is suitable for customers who lack the space or resources for on-site recycling.</p></p>
