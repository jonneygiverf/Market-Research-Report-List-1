<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRP Grating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Molded FRP Grating</li><li>Pultruded FRP Grating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The FRP grating market consists of two main types: molded FRP grating and pultruded FRP grating. Molded FRP grating is created by combining resin and fiberglass, and it offers exceptional corrosion resistance, strength, and durability. This type of grating is commonly used in walkways, platforms, and other industrial applications. On the other hand, pultruded FRP grating is made by pulling fiberglass strands through resin and forming them into a grid-like structure. It is known for its high strength-to-weight ratio and is commonly used in applications that require heavy load-bearing capacity. Both types of FRP grating are popular due to their non-slip properties, low maintenance requirements, and resistance to chemicals and fire.</p></p>
