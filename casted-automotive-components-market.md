<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casted Automotive Components Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Squeeze Casting</li><li>Investment Casting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The casted automotive components market is comprised of different types of casting processes. Two commonly used methods are squeeze casting and investment casting. Squeeze casting involves injecting molten metal into a preheated die and applying pressure to fill intricate shapes quickly. This process results in higher mechanical properties and improved surface finishes. On the other hand, investment casting (also known as lost-wax casting) uses a wax model coated with ceramic material to create a mold. The wax is melted and replaced by molten metal to form the desired component with intricate details.</p></p>
