<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The truck tire market can be classified into two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with layers of steel belts positioned radially under the tread, providing better stability and allowing the tire to flex more efficiently. This design increases fuel efficiency and offers a smoother ride. On the other hand, bias tires are built with multiple layers of fabric cords crisscrossed at an angle, which provides greater durability and puncture resistance. However, bias tires generally have a stiffer ride and lower fuel efficiency compared to radial tires.</p></p>
