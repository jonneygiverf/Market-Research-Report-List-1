<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Autoclave Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>SFPP</li><li>Pre-Vac</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Horizontal autoclaves are used for sterilization in various industries. Gravity sterilization is a simple process, where steam is injected into the chamber, creating pressure and heat to sterilize the contents. SFPP (Single-Fluid-Pressure-Pulse) autoclaves use pulses of steam to achieve effective sterilization and are often used for delicate materials. Pre-Vac (Pre-Vacuum) autoclaves create a vacuum before steam injection, ensuring better penetration for sterilizing porous items. Each type offers specific advantages and is chosen based on the requirements of the materials being sterilized.</p></p>
