<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TBM Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tail Sealants</li><li>Main Drive Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>TBM sealants refer to sealants used in Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) to prevent water or soil infiltration during construction. Tail sealants are specifically used to seal the TBM tail section, where the machine is connected to the tunnel lining. Main drive sealants, on the other hand, are employed to seal the main drive section of the TBM, which consists of the cutter head and the motor assembly. Both types of sealants serve the purpose of maintaining the integrity and stability of the tunnel excavation process.</p></p>
