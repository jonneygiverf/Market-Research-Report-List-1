<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Thermal Imager Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blue Film Base</li><li>Clear Film Base</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Dry Thermal Imager market can be categorized into two types based on the imaging base: Blue Film Base and Clear Film Base. Blue Film Base thermal imagers utilize a blue-colored film base that enhances the image contrast and offers improved visibility of thermal patterns. On the other hand, Clear Film Base thermal imagers use a transparent film base, which provides a more accurate representation of thermal patterns but may have slightly lower contrast compared to blue film base imagers. Both types serve the purpose of capturing and displaying thermal information with varying degrees of contrast and accuracy.</p></p>
