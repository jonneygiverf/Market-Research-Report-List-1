<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microbial Biorational Pesticide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insecticides</li><li>Fungicides</li><li>Nematicides</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Microbial biorational pesticides are biological products derived from certain microorganisms that can effectively control pests, diseases, and nematodes in agriculture. Insecticides are microbial biorational pesticides specifically targeted towards insects. They suppress or eliminate insect populations by affecting their physiology or behavior. Fungicides, on the other hand, are microbial biorational pesticides designed to manage fungal diseases in crops. They inhibit fungal growth and reproduction. Nematicides are microbial biorational pesticides that control nematode populations, a type of microscopic roundworm, which can cause crop damage and yield losses. They disrupt nematode physiology and reproductive capacity.</p></p>
