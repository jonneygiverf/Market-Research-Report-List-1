<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Carbonate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC)</li><li>Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The calcium carbonate market is divided into two main types: Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC) and Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC). GCC is obtained through the mechanical crushing, grinding, and sizing of limestone rocks, resulting in powdered or granular form for various industrial applications. On the other hand, PCC is produced through a chemical process where limestone is reacted with carbon dioxide and other additives, resulting in a fine, white powder suitable for industries such as paper, paints, adhesives, and plastics. Both GCC and PCC have significant roles in different industries, offering versatility and diverse applications.</p></p>
