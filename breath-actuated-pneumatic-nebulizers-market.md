<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breath-actuated Pneumatic Nebulizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Capacity</li><li>High Capacity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breath-actuated pneumatic nebulizers are a type of medical device used to deliver medication to the airways of patients with respiratory conditions. There are two types of these nebulizers: small capacity and high capacity. Small capacity nebulizers are designed for single doses of medication and are commonly used in home settings. High capacity nebulizers, on the other hand, are used in hospitals or clinics as they can deliver larger volumes of medication over a longer period of time. Both types work by converting medication into a fine mist that can be inhaled by the patient for efficient treatment.</p></p>
