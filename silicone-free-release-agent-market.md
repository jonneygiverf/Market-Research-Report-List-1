<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone-Free Release Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silicone-Free Release Agent market includes two main types: spray and liquid. Spray release agents are commonly used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and mold making. They are applied by spraying a thin layer on the surface to prevent adhesion between the mold and the material being molded, allowing for easy release. On the other hand, liquid release agents are applied using brushes or cloths and are suitable for more intricate molds or situations where spraying is not feasible. Both types offer the advantage of being silicone-free, making them suitable for applications where silicone contamination is a concern.</p></p>
