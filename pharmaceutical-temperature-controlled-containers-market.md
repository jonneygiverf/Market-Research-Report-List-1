<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Temperature-Controlled Containers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Control</li><li>Passive Control</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pharmaceutical temperature-controlled containers market includes two types: active control and passive control. Active control containers utilize an internal system to actively regulate and maintain the required temperature, using equipment such as heaters or coolers. They can provide precise temperature control but require a power source. On the other hand, passive control containers rely on pre-conditioned packaging materials, like insulation or phase change materials, to passively maintain the desired temperature. While they do not require a power source, their temperature control may be less precise than active control containers.</p></p>
