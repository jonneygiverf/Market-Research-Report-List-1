<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Utility Task Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HEV</li><li>BEV</li><li>FCEV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electrical Utility Task Vehicles (ETUV) market can be categorized into three types: Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV), Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV). HEVs combine both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to power the vehicle, typically using gasoline or diesel fuel. BEVs solely utilize electric power stored in batteries to operate, eliminating the need for fossil fuels. FCEVs employ hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, which then powers the vehicle's electric motor, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct.</p></p>
