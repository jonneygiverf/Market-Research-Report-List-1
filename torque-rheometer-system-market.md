<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Torque Rheometer System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Screw Rheometer</li><li>Twin Screw Rheometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Torque rheometer systems, used to measure the rheological properties of materials, come in two main types: single screw rheometer and twin screw rheometer. Single screw rheometers have a single screw mechanism that applies torque to the material, allowing for viscosity and melt strength analysis. Twin screw rheometers use two screws, enabling more accurate measurements of properties like mixing ability and pellet quality. Both systems are essential for industries like polymer manufacturing, as they provide valuable data for product development and quality control purposes.</p></p>
