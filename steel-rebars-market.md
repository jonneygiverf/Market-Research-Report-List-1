<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Rebars Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Steel rebars are widely used in construction for reinforcing concrete structures. There are two main types of steel rebars in the market: deformed steel and mild steel. Deformed steel rebars have ribs, lugs, or indentations on their surface to enhance the bond with concrete, providing better strength and durability. On the other hand, mild steel rebars have a smooth surface and are commonly used in non-critical applications. Both types serve their purpose in construction projects by providing structural integrity and preventing cracking or collapse of concrete structures.</p></p>
