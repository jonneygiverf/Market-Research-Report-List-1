<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Seamless Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-rolled Steel Seamless Pipes</li><li>Cold-rolled Steel Seamless Pipes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Steel seamless pipes are used in various industries for transportation of fluids or gases. Hot-rolled steel seamless pipes are manufactured by heating a solid round billet and then piercing it to form a hollow tube. This process results in a rougher surface and higher dimensional tolerances. On the other hand, cold-rolled steel seamless pipes are made by rolling a steel sheet at room temperature, resulting in a smoother surface finish and tighter dimensional tolerances. Both types of pipes have their unique applications and advantages based on the specific requirements of the industry.</p></p>
